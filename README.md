# Minigolf

A 13-hole minigolf microgame targeted for mobile use cases! Hosted free on [Itch.io page](https://llamacademy.itch.io/minigolf)

This microgame was created as a means to show and teach how different aspects of a game can be created. See the [Challenges](./Challenges.md) for some challenges to test your understanding!

Tutorials covering all aspects of this game can be found on this [YouTube Playlist]()

## Quickstart
1. Open LlamAcademy/Minigolf/Scenes/Main Menu.unity
   1. Ensure you have a vertical aspect ratio for your game view (something like 9:16)
2. Click play!

## Recommended Build Targets
1. WebGL
2. Android
3. iOS

Others should also work, but the controls and UI are mobile-oriented so probably require some rework to be acceptable on other platforms.
